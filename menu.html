                Latte is a type of coffee made with espresso and steamed milk. It's typically served in a tall glass or mug, with the espresso shot at the bottom and the steamed milk poured on top. A latte is often topped with a layer of frothed milk, which is created by heating and aerating the milk with a steam wand. The frothed milk creates a creamy, smooth texture and adds a sweet, slightly nutty flavor to the drink. Lattes are often enjoyed with added flavorings such as vanilla or caramel syrup, and can also be made with alternative milks such as soy, 
                almond, or oat milk for those who are lactose intolerant or vegan.

                Iced latte is a popular coffee drink that consists of espresso and cold milk, usually served over ice. The term "latte" comes from the Italian "caffè latte," which means "milk coffee." In its iced form, it is often made by pouring espresso shots over ice and adding cold milk to it. Sometimes it is also flavored with syrups like vanilla, caramel, or hazelnut to give it a different taste. Iced latte is a refreshing drink that is perfect for 
                hot summer days or as a pick-me-up during a long day at work.
